# PELinker
A Work in progress linker for the Portable Executable (.exe) format. To be used in conjunction with a work in progress compiler.

## Purpose
This project is part of my work in progress compiler.
The compiler itself parses a pseudo-C# like language.
I've seperated the project into a parser, code generator and linker. 
The other parts will be added onto github later on as they are still a major work in progress.

Technically this project serves no purpose just yet, other than maybe showcasing how to build a .exe from scratch.


## Installation
Not applicable. Part of a work in progress Compiler.

## Usage
    linker.exe -o test.exe unit_test_x.ci
